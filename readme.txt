This my practice for learning python basic tutorial.
These practices are .ipynb files,because I practiced on jupterlab.
The practice includes basic syntax,variable types, loops,sequences,I/O,Classes/Objects etc.
I write an index in the first line of each .ipynb file,which indicates for what part I have practiced in this file.
For the reason of convenience, I used a lot Chinese in the index and comment.
In the future,I will try to change them into English.
